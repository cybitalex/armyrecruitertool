## AI Models Available

The default model is `llama-3.1-70b-versatile`, which provides:

## Without API Key

If you don't configure an API key, the assistant will still appear but will show helpful setup instructions instead of answering questions.

## Free Tier Limits

Groq's free tier is very generous:

- Thousands of requests per day
- Fast inference (faster than GPT-4)
- No credit card required
- Multiple models available

## Privacy & Security

- Your API key is stored locally in `.env` (never committed to git)

## Troubleshooting

### "AI Assistant requires a Groq API key"
