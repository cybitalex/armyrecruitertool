# Logo Setup Instructions

## Required Logo File

Place your Army Recruiting Command logo in this directory (`client/public/logos/`):

### `recruiting-logo.png`

- The Army Recruiting Command logo (red/blue circular badge with Liberty Bell and "RECRUITING" text)
- Should have a **transparent background**
- Recommended size: 256x256px or higher
- Format: PNG with transparency

## How to Add the Logo

### Quick Steps:

1. Save your recruiting logo image with transparent background
2. Name it: `recruiting-logo.png`
3. Place it in: `/Users/alexmoran/Documents/programming/ArmyRecruitTool/client/public/logos/`
4. Refresh your browser

### Command Line:

```bash
# From your project root
cd client/public/logos

# Copy your logo file here
cp ~/Downloads/recruiting-logo.png .
```

## Removing Background (If Needed)

If your logo doesn't have a transparent background:

### Online Tool (Easiest):

1. Go to: **https://remove.bg**
2. Upload your recruiting logo
3. Download the PNG with transparent background
4. Save as `recruiting-logo.png`

### Mac Users:

- Open in **Preview** ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Instant Alpha ‚Üí Click white/background areas

### Windows/Other:

- Use **GIMP** (free) or **Photoshop**
- Select background with magic wand tool
- Delete background
- Save as PNG

## Verifying It Works

After placing the file:

1. Refresh browser at http://localhost:5001
2. Logo should appear in the header (left side)
3. If not showing: Check browser console (F12) for errors

## Current Header Layout:

```
[Recruiting Logo] | U.S. ARMY
                  | RECRUITING OPERATIONS    [Navigation Buttons ‚Üí]
```

The logo displays at **64x64px** with:

- Transparent background
- Professional drop shadow
- Crisp rendering at any zoom level

## Troubleshooting

**Logo not showing?**

- Check file name is exactly: `recruiting-logo.png` (case-sensitive)
- Verify file is in correct folder: `client/public/logos/`
- Confirm file is PNG format
- Try hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

**Logo looks pixelated?**

- Use higher resolution image (at least 256x256px)
- PNG format maintains quality better than JPG

**Background not transparent?**

- Re-save with transparency using tools above
- Check that PNG has alpha channel

**Ready!** Once you add `recruiting-logo.png`, your official Army Recruiting Command logo will appear in the header! üéñÔ∏è
