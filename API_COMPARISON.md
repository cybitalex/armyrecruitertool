## My Recommendation

### Start Here (What You Have Now):
1. ✅ **OpenStreetMap** - Already working!
2. ✅ **Add Eventbrite** - Takes 2 minutes, gets you real events
3. ✅ **Add Hugging Face** - Takes 1 minute, gets you AI help

**Result:** Fully functional recruiting tool for $0/month

### Add Later (If Needed):
4. **Google Places** - Only if you really need ratings/hours

Most recruiters won't need Google Places. OpenStreetMap + Eventbrite covers 95% of use cases.

## Support & Troubleshooting

- **OpenStreetMap not working?** Check console for errors
- **No events found?** Add Eventbrite API key
- **AI not responding?** Check HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY in .env
- **Want more data?** Consider adding Google Places

## Documentation
