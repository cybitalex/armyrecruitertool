# üîí Security Guidelines - US Army NIPR Compliant

This application is designed to handle **UNCLASSIFIED** information only, following US Army NIPR (Non-classified Internet Protocol Router) security guidelines.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: UNCLASSIFIED USE ONLY

**DO NOT** store, process, or transmit:

- ‚ùå Classified information (CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET)
- ‚ùå Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) without proper authorization
- ‚ùå For Official Use Only (FOUO) without proper safeguards
- ‚ùå Personally Identifiable Information (PII) beyond recruiting necessities
- ‚ùå Protected Health Information (PHI)
- ‚ùå Social Security Numbers (SSNs) - **NOT COLLECTED**

**This system is authorized for UNCLASSIFIED recruiting data only.**

**Note:** SSN data is intentionally NOT collected to minimize security risks and PII exposure. This system focuses on prospecting and initial interest tracking only.

## üîê Best Practices for Deployment

### 1. **Use HTTPS Only**

Never deploy without SSL/TLS certificates.

```bash
# Force HTTPS redirect in nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

### 2. **Rotate API Keys Regularly**

- Google Places API keys: Every 90 days
- PredictHQ API keys: Every 90 days
- Internal tokens: Every 30 days

### 3. **Implement Authentication**

For production use on NIPR:

- Integrate with Army SSO
- Require CAC/PIV cards
- Implement multi-factor authentication

### 4. **Regular Security Updates**

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Update Node.js dependencies
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Update PM2
npm install -g pm2@latest
```

### 5. **Monitor and Audit**

- Review logs daily
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Track unusual API usage
- Regular security assessments
